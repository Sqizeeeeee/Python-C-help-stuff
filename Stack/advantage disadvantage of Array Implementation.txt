Advantages of Array Implementation:

- Easy to implement.
- Memory is saved as pointers are not involved.



Disadvantages of Array Implementation:

- It is not dynamic i.e., it doesnâ€™t grow and shrink depending on needs at runtime. [But in case of dynamic sized arrays like vector in C++, list in Python, ArrayList in Java, stacks can grow and shrink with array implementation as well]. But with dynamic sized arrays, we get amortized time complexity as O(1), not the worst case. If we use linked list, we get worst case time complexities as O(1).
- The total size of the stack must be defined beforehand.
